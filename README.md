# Overview

This is a tictactoe game made with android studio and Kotlin programming language.

The app uses buttons to represent the 9 squares on a tictactoe table. Clicking each button makes a call to a function, which initiates the game logic.
The button changes color after each click, and the button is disabled, to avoid overwriting the value of a button. At the end, Either player one or two wins.

I created this app to further learn the application of Kotlin.
